DarkAuth

DarkAuth is a sophisticated authentication bypass and automated transfer tool designed to streamline the process of accessing accounts and performing transactions on websites such as PayPal. It combines advanced authentication methods, browser automation, machine learning optimization, and multi-factor authentication to provide a powerful and versatile solution for users.

Features
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): DarkAuth incorporates MFA functionality by sending verification codes via SMS to users' phone numbers, adding an extra layer of security to the authentication process.

Browser Automation: The program leverages Selenium to automate browser interactions, allowing users to seamlessly navigate websites, log in, and perform transactions with ease.

Machine Learning Optimization: DarkAuth utilizes machine learning algorithms to optimize transfer parameters, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in automated transactions.

Dynamic Proxy Handling: The program supports SOCKS5 proxies for routing browser traffic through different IP addresses, ensuring anonymity and evading detection.

Comprehensive Logging: DarkAuth maintains detailed logs of user interactions, authentication attempts, SMS verifications, machine learning model accuracy, and other relevant information for audit and analysis purposes.
